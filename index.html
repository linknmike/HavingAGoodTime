	<p>
		One of my favorite books is Unsong.<br>
		It's about an apocalypse.<br>
		In the story, Apollo 8 crashed into the crystal sphere surrounding the Earth.<br>
		This means that demons, angels, and magic are reentering the world.<br>
		The main character's name is Aaron.<br>
		It can be read for free online.<br>
